# JavaDesignPattern

<p>The following Design Patterns has been illustrated in this project</p> 
<p>Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development</p> 

<ul>
	<li>Abstract Factory</li>
  <p>In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.</p>
	<li>Iterator</li>
  <p>Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation.</p>
  <p>Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.</p>
  <li>Adapter</li>
   <p>The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expects. This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.</p>
    <li>Visitor</li>
    <p>
    In Visitor pattern, we use a visitor class which changes the executing algorithm of an element class. By this way, execution algorithm of element can vary as and when visitor varies. This pattern comes under behavior pattern category. As per the pattern, element object has to accept the visitor object so that visitor object handles the operation on the element object.</p>
  
</ul>
